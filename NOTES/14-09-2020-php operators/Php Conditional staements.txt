PHP Conditional Statements
--------------------------

In PHP we have the following conditional statements:

	1.if statement - executes some code if one condition is true
	2.if...else statement - executes some code if a condition is true and another code if that condition is false
	3.if...elseif...else statement - executes different codes for more than two conditions
	4.switch statement - selects one of many blocks of code to be executed


PHP - The if Statement
----------------------

The if statement executes some code if one condition is true.

Syntax
if (condition) {
  code to be executed if condition is true;
}


PHP - The if...else Statement
-----------------------------

The if...else statement executes some code if a condition is true and another code if that condition is false.

Syntax
if (condition) {
  code to be executed if condition is true;
} else {
  code to be executed if condition is false;
}


PHP - The if...elseif...else Statement
--------------------------------------

The if...elseif...else statement executes different codes for more than two conditions.

Syntax
if (condition) {
  code to be executed if this condition is true;
} elseif (condition) {
  code to be executed if first condition is false and this condition is true;
} else {
  code to be executed if all conditions are false;
}


PHP - The switch Statement
--------------------------

The switch statement is used to perform different actions based on different conditions.

Use the switch statement to select one of many blocks of code to be executed.

Syntax
switch (n) {
  case label1:
    code to be executed if n=label1;
    break;
  case label2:
    code to be executed if n=label2;
    break;
  case label3:
    code to be executed if n=label3;
    break;
    ...
  default:
    code to be executed if n is different from all labels;
}
