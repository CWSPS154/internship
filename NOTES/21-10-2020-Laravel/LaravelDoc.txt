How Laravel works
	The files that intract with users are located in the directory your-project-folder/resources/views/

		eg:<form action="/log" method="post">
	
	The files actions are route by the file located in directory your-project-folder/routes/web.php

		Syntax:Route :get/post('name that given the for the action/{parameter}','controller-name@function-name for the action');

		eg:
		   Route::post('register','register_controller@register');
		   Route::get('/home', 'HomeController@index');

	The files actions are controlled by the respective controllers,we can create multiple controllers for different action or using the same,
	in the controllers functions are specifying the actions
		eg:
			public function register(Request $req)
   			 {
   			 	$regg=new register_model();

    				$regg->name=$req->name;
    				$regg->email=$req->email;
    				$regg->password=$req->password_confirmation;
    				$regg->save();
    				return redirect('/');
  			  }


How View a blade in Laravel 

	The Code in the controller:

		public function function_name()
    			{
      			  return view('blade_name');
   			 }
	The Code In the web.php

		Route::get('any_name','vmedico_controller@function_name');

	The Code In blade
		<a href="/any_name/">Link</a>

	*any_name:Name for call the function through route


csrf_token
	A CSRF token is a unique, secret, unpredictable value that is generated by the server-side application 
	and transmitted to the client in such a way that it is included in a subsequent HTTP request made by the client.

	<input type="hidden" name="_token" value="<?php echo csrf_token() ?>">
