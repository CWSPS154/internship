PHP Data Types
--------------
Variables can store data of different types, 
and different data types can do different things.

PHP supports the following data types:

1.String
2.Integer
3.Float (floating point numbers - also called double)
4.Boolean
5.Array
6.Object
7.NULL
8.Resource

1.PHP String
------------

A string is a sequence of characters, like "Hello world!".

A string can be any text inside quotes. You can use single or double quotes:

Example:-

<?php
$x = "Hello world!";
$y = 'Hello world!';

echo $x;
echo "<br>";
echo $y;
?>

2.PHP Integer
--------------

An integer data type is a non-decimal number between -2,147,483,648 and 2,147,483,647.

Rules for integers:

An integer must have at least one digit
An integer must not have a decimal point
An integer can be either positive or negative
Integers can be specified in: decimal (base 10), hexadecimal (base 16), octal (base 8), or binary (base 2) notation

In the following example $x is an integer. The PHP var_dump() function returns the data type and value:

Example:-

<?php
$x = 5985;
var_dump($x);
?>

3.PHP Float
-----------

A float (floating point number) is a number with a decimal point or a number in exponential form.

In the following example $x is a float. The PHP var_dump() function returns the data type and value:

Example:-

<?php
$x = 10.365;
var_dump($x);
?>

4.PHP Boolean
-------------

A Boolean represents two possible states: TRUE or FALSE.

$x = true;
$y = false;
Booleans are often used in conditional testing.

5.PHP Array
-----------

An array stores multiple values in one single variable.

In the following example $cars is an array. The PHP var_dump() function returns the data type and value:

Example:-

<?php
$cars = array("Volvo","BMW","Toyota");
var_dump($cars);
?>

6.PHP Object
------------
An object is a data type which stores data and information on how to process that data.

In PHP, an object must be explicitly declared.

First we must declare a class of object. For this, we use the class keyword. A class is a structure that can contain properties and methods:

Example:-

<?php
class Car {
  function Car() {
    $this->model = "VW";
  }
}

// create an object
$herbie = new Car();

// show object properties
echo $herbie->model;
?>

7.PHP NULL Value
-----------------

Null is a special data type which can have only one value: NULL.

A variable of data type NULL is a variable that has no value assigned to it.

Tip: If a variable is created without a value, it is automatically assigned a value of NULL.

Variables can also be emptied by setting the value to NULL:

Example:-

<?php
$x = "Hello world!";
$x = null;
var_dump($x);
?>

8.PHP Resource
--------------

The special resource type is not an actual data type. It is the storing of a reference to functions and resources external to PHP.

A common example of using the resource data type is a database call.
