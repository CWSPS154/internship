Types Of Sql 
-------------
There are five types of SQL commands: DDL, DML, DCL, TCL, and DQL.

1.Data Definition Language(DDL)
-------------------------------

DDL changes the structure of the table like creating a table, deleting a table, altering a table, etc.

All the command of DDL are auto-committed that means it permanently save all the changes in the database.
	a.CREATE-It is used to create a new table in the database.
	b.ALTER	-It is used to alter the structure of the database. This change could be either to modify the characteristics of an existing attribute or probably to add a new attribute.
	c.DROP -It is used to delete both the structure and record stored in the table.
	d.TRUNCATE -It is used to delete all the rows from the table and free the space containing the table.

2. Data Manipulation Language(DML)
----------------------------------	
	a. INSERT - It is used to insert data into the row of a table.
	b. UPDATE - It is used to update or modify the value of a column in the table.
	c. DELETE - It is used to remove one or more row from a table.
	
3. Data Control Language(DCL)
------------------------------
	a. Grant -It is used to give user access privileges to a database.
	b. Revoke - It is used to take back permissions from the user.
	
4. Transaction Control Language(TCL)
------------------------------------
	a. Commit - It is used to save all the transactions to the database.
	b. Rollback - It is used to undo transactions that have not already been saved to the database.
	c. SAVEPOINT - It is used to roll the transaction back to a certain point without rolling back the entire transaction.

5. Data Query Language(DQL)
---------------------------
	a. SELECT - This is the same as the projection operation of relational algebra. It is used to select the attribute based on the condition described by WHERE clause.
