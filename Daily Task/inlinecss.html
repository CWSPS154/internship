	The Catholic Christian community at Deva Matha Forane Church, Paisakary, under the Syro-Malabar Metropolitan Archdioceses of Thalassery, wanted an institution of higher learning for a long time for the higher education of its youth, and thus to bring about the all-round development of the region. Their long-cherished dream saw fruition under the able leadership of the then Vicar of Deva Matha Forane Church, Rev. Fr. John Mullakkara (2003-2005).

Deva Matha College, a self-financing venture and affiliated to the University of Kannur, started functioning from the Academic Year 2003–’04 in the ground floor of the now St. Thomas Block, under the visionary leadership of the Rev. Fr. John Mullakkara, the Founder-Manager. The College is situated on a hillock with a panoramic view as the site is encircled by the majestic mountain range which is part of the Western Ghats in the Payyavoor Panchayath, Kannur.
