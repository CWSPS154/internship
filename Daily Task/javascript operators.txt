JavaScript Arithmetic Operators

	Arithmetic operators are used to perform arithmetic on numbers

Operator	Description
+		Addition
-		Subtraction
*		Multiplication
**		Exponentiation (ES2016)
/		Division
%		Modulus (Division Remainder)
++		Increment
--		Decrement

Example

	var x = 100 + 50;		(Values)
	var x = a + b;			(variables)
	var x = (100 + 50) * a;		(Expressions)

JavaScript Assignment Operators

	Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables.

Operator	Example		Same As
=		x = y		x = y
+=		x += y		x = x + y
-=		x -= y		x = x - y
*=		x *= y		x = x * y
/=		x /= y		x = x / y
%=		x %= y		x = x % y

Example
	var x = 10;
	x += 5;

Comparison Operators

	Comparison operators are used in logical statements to determine equality or difference between variables or values.

Operator	Description		
==		equal to	
===		equal value and equal type	
!=		not equal	
!==		not equal value or not equal type	
>		greater than		
<		less than		
>=		greater than or equal to		
<=		less than or equal to	

Logical Operators

	Logical operators are used to determine the logic between variables or values.

Operator	Description	
&&		and	
||		or	
!		not	

Conditional (Ternary) Operator

	JavaScript also contains a conditional operator that assigns a value to a variable based on some condition.

Syntax

	variablename = (condition) ? value1:value2

Example

	var voteable = (age < 18) ? "Too young":"Old enough";

JavaScript Loops

	Loops are handy, if you want to run the same code over and over again, each time with a different value.

Different Kinds of Loops

JavaScript supports different kinds of loops:

for - loops through a block of code a number of times
for/in - loops through the properties of an object
for/of - loops through the values of an iterable object
while - loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true
do/while - also loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true
